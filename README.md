# mnsh
mnsh: Non-standard command shell optimized for Linux

The idea of this project goes back to 2015, when I creeated a large college project for Advanced Unix Programming class named FISH (Fantastically Incredible Shell).

Using bash in Linux for over a decade, I accumulated a lot of things that "could be implemented better" in standard Unix shells like bash, csh, ksh, etc. Seems like it is right time to do so.

Suggestions are highly appreciated.
